This is a repository to upload all my daily programming journey and not die trying! :') 🤡

I saw this idea and I agree that maybe doing this would set to force myself to program every single day (or as much as I can) which is crucial to become better and learn properly. 💡 🍻

The content will be based on problems from platforms or stuff I found online. 👽

There's no end here. 💀💀 

Start on February 2nd 2022. Wish me luck!!! 🍀
